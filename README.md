Well. My name is Wenming Zhou, and I’m a software engineer with more than 2 years’ development experience. At the beginning of my developer career, I worked as a Java engineer at a company running internet based, shared bus business. I got started on full-stack development and a little of DevOps from my current firm which focuses on IT consulting. As a web developer, I have knowledge and experience of both back-end and front-end web development. I confirm that most of them are used in practice, and I’m a little short of oral expression. But that’s the field where I’m dedicated to and there’s supposed to be a change. That’s all for it. Thank you very much.



The PerformPlus is a web based application that has been developed to support the Consulting Perform methodology for PwC UK. It is comprised of two separate applications: Information Centre App and Profile App, they are accessed via two URLs.
The Information Centre App is intended to be an application that is accessed and ran on a TV Screen as it contains information that is relevant to an entire team and is used on a daily basis by the team during their daily 15-minute meeting which navigates through the Information Centre App to access specific content for that team and for individuals within that team as part of the Perform methodology.
The Profile App is intended to be used by an individual from a team to enable them to provide necessary information, content and updates about their individual performance and that would be made available within the Information Centre App for the team that they belong to. The Profile App is a more personal space for a user as opposed to the Information Center which is relevant to the entire team.
The PerformPlus application is currently built and hosted on the Google Cloud Platform based on a Node.js backend layer with APIs created using the Loopback framework and connected to a Cloud SQL instance, along with a React + Redux based frontend application which also makes use of GraphQL to support efficient data fetching from the API layer and Web Sockets for real time connection and updates between the frontend and backend components.

Continually involved to the whole part.

PerformPlus是一个基于网络的应用程序，旨在支持普华永道英国的咨询方法论业务。整个体系由两大主要应用构成：Information Centre和Profile，两者通过独立URL进行访问。
Information Centre是一个旨在通过电视大屏幕媒介访问和运行的应用，它包含与整个用户业务团队相关的信息，在团队日常的一刻钟会议中发挥重要作用。通过导航，用户可以访问到不同团队及其成员的特定信息内容。
Profile供团队成员使用，每个队员提供、更新个人相关信息，之后可供他们所属团队在Information Centre中使用。另外，成员分为四个角色，操作权限依：主管、经理、组长、员工依次降低。
整个应用目前构建、托管在谷歌云上。技术栈方面，后端依托Node.js，使用Loopback框架创建API层、连接Cloud SQL Instance；前端依托React + Redux，并使用GraphQL有效从API层获取数据，运用Web Sockets在前后端之间实时连接与更新。

持续参与整个项目的开发。
